In This section we are going to go throught the below concepts:

1) All about images, the building blocks of containers
2) Whats there in an image and what isn't.
3) Using Docker Hub Registry
4) Managing our local image cache
5) Building our own image 

What's in an Image (And what isn't)
====================================
1) So an images are binaries and dependancies for our applications and the metadata about the image data and how to
    run that image.
2) Am image is not a complete OS. There is no kernel inside an image, No kernel modules like drivers or anything. Its simply just a binaries that
    application needs to run, and the host(on which this image run inside container) itself provide the kernel. And thats what make docker 
    different from other virtual technologies. In docker, booting up a container with the help of an image is nothing but starting a new application.
3) This image in docker could be as small as one file(app binary) like a golang static binary. Or i could be as Big as Ubuntu distro with apt,
    and apache, PHP and more software installed.
