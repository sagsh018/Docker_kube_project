1) One important command noted for stapping/starting containers, removing containers, removing images in bulk
    # docker container stop $(docker container ls -aq)
    # docker container rm $(docker container ls -aq)
2) Note that while doing the docker container exec -it, we could only execute another command if and only if the container is having
    initial/primary command running 
    for example in case of nginx container, the initial process of nginx should be running and then only we could execute other
    command using docker container exec like bash, netstat, ping.
    Also note that this second command will not start again after container restart
3) -it flag in docker container exec command
    --interactive/-i : This flag keeps the stdin stream open even if not attached.
    --tty/-t : This flag allocates pseudo-TTY for your session inside container.
4) Default command for container:
    This is basically a default command that runs at the start of container
    This is usually hard coded in the Dockerfile.
    We could override it by two methods:
        a) Either changing it inside the Dockerfile
        b) Giving it at the time of container run
            # docker container run -d --name nginx -p 8080:80 nginx sleep 50
    The PID for this process will be PID 1 and as soon as this process will stop the container will exit.
5) Restart policies provided by docker to control whether your containers start automatically when they exit or when docker restarts
    Restart policies (using --restart option)
    =========================================
    a) Flag -> no : Do not automatically restart the container (default)
    b) Flag -> on-failure : Restart the container if it exits due to error, which manifests as non zero exit code
    c) Flag -> unless-stopped : Restart the container unless it is explicitly stopped or docker itself stopped or restart(This is the 
        one we use most in production)
    d) Flag -> always : Always restart the container if it stops.
    # docker container run -d --name nginx -p 8080:80 --restart unless-stopped nginx
6) To check how much space all components of docker are taking on the host VM :
    # docker system df 
    # docker system df -v (give per component)
