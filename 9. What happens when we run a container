So below are the steps taken place when we run docker container run command
1) Docker looks for the image we are trying to run as container in the image cache. if it does not find it then,
2) it looks for the same image in the remote repository of docker ( default to docker hub)
3) Then it download the latest version of that image from docker hub by default. Note that we could also provide the version of the image   
    to download as well.
4) Then docker creates a new container based on that downloaded image and prepares it to start.
5) Docker then configure the network of that container by giving a virtual IP on a private network inside the docker engine.
6) Opens the port 80 on host and forward the port 80 in the container. Notice that since we have mentioned in our command to publish the ports 
    than only docker taken the action otherwise docker does not do this by default.
7) Finalyy it starts the container based on the commands writtin inside the Dockerfile of the image.

We can modify out command and give many of the values and options at the time of running docker container run command. see the example below

# docker container run --publish 8080:80 --name webhost -d nginx:1.11 nginx -T 
    So here we have included the options for :
    a) exposing the port 8080 on host machine(VM running inside our VB in our case) and mapping it to port 80 of container.
    b) giving name of a container
    c) giving -d option for --detach to that container runs in background process.
    e) mentioned the name of image to be used along with the verion by using the colon.
    f) finally we have also mentioned the command that will run when the first time container will start.
