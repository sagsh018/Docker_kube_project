1) So here we have our Virtual machine running on VMware and we are going to run linux native containers directly on 
    linux.
2) Docker on linux is an easiest install/setup, and it is a best native experience. So in this case there is no
    emulation or any VM running on a Virtual box.
3) There are three main ways of installing docker on linux : script, store or docker-machine
    a) Script
        get.docker.com script(This gives the latest release)
        # curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
    b) hub.docker.com has instructions for each distribution(like : ubuntu, RHEL, Debian, Fedore)
        RHEL officially only support Docker EE (paid), but Centos will work
        We can install docker on VM, clud instance, all are same
        Yes, it may not work for unlisted distribution like : Amazon Linux, Linode Linux, etc
        Do not use pre installed setup for docker like (Digital ocean, Linode, etc)

Docker for Linux : setup
========================
1) Update our package manager and install docker
2) Add our user account to the docker group so that you can run docker commands without using sudo
3) Clone a Github repo having all codes from udemy
4) get the code editor. again we already have VScode
5) Tweak your terminal and shell (optional)

6) So now we are going to try out the way to install the docker using script which we have explained above.
7) Go the below link
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/#install-using-the-convenience-script
    This page has detailed step to install docker for all three methods
    a) setup docker repo and install from them.
    b) Download the RPM package and install it manually and manage upgrades completely manually
    c) Using automated convenience scripts to install docker
8) Lets start with installing docker using script
    =============================================
    a) Suppose we want to install a edge release of docker in order to perform some testing or some temp tasks.
    b) We can go the following link https://get.docker.com/, Which has the script for installing a docker 
    c) Noe there are few thins to note about this script installation for either edge version of the test version.
        i) The scripts require root or sudo privileges to run. there for these scripts should be ran carefully.
        ii) The scripts attempt to detect your linux distribution and version and configure your package management 
            system for you. but, the scripts do not allow you to customize any of the installation parameter 
        iii) The scripts install all dependencies and recommendations of the package manager without asking for c
                confirmation.
        iv) The scripts do allow to specify which version of docker you need, it install the latest edge release.
    d) So in order to install docker edge release and docker test release using https://get.docker.com/ and 
        https://test.docker.com/ 
    e) if we go to the following page of edge docker script : https://get.docker.com/.
        you will find there the installation steps in the introduction to the script 
        #!/bin/sh
        set -e
        # Docker CE for Linux installation script
        #
        # See https://docs.docker.com/install/ for the installation steps.
        #
        # This script is meant for quick & easy install via:
        #   $ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
        #   $ sh get-docker.sh
        So we are going to use below commands

        # curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
        # sudo sh get-docker.sh
        Note that this method is going to insall docker-ce package in the background
        once the installation completes , we can do the final step to add current user ID to the docker group, so that
        user can use the docker commands without using sudo.
        # sudo usermod -aG docker redhat
        So this command is introduce in order to add your user to docker group so that your user can run docker command
        without using sudo, but some linux enterprises like centos and rhel made it mendatory to use sudo in the docker
        commands, even if the user id added to the docker group.

        So after installation of docker using script as above you can check the below commands
        # sudo docker version
9) Now lets also understand the method of installing docker on linux using repository
    a) So we are as some non root user on our VM inside that non root user home directory. So we will start by installing
        yum-utils package ( Which is going to provide yum-config-manager utility) and set up the stable repo
        # sudo yum install yum-utils -y        
        # sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
    b)  Repository 'rhel-7-server-extras-rpms' is enabled for this system
        # sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms ( This is to avoid errors related to 
            container-selinux)
    c)  To install latest version of docker Engine and containered
            # sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
    d) To start the docker service
        # sudo systemctl start docker ; sudo systemctl enable docker
    e) Now again you can add sharmasag user id into docjer group as a secondary group, but it is not going to be of any use
        as according to new standards we will have to be sudo user to run docker commands as docker is going to perform 
        operations at kernel level.
        # sudo usermod -aG docker sharmasag
10) Now after installation of this docker, we have 2 more things that need to be installed in case of linux separately
    those are "docker machine" and "docker compose"
11) Open up the following URL and follow the steps as :
    a) Download the docker-machine binary and extract it the PATH
        curl -L https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.16.0/docker-machine-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) >/tmp/docker-machine &&
        chmod +x /tmp/docker-machine &&
        sudo cp -p /tmp/docker-machine /usr/local/bin/docker-machine
        Then we can check the version of docker-machine
        docker-machine --version
12) Now after installation of docker-machine binary, we are now going to install docker-docker compose.
    a) reach out to following URL ==> https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
        # sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.26.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    b) sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    c) docker-compose --version
13) Last thing is we can clone the repo of Docker based on udemy course form the below URL and below command
    git clone https://github.com/sagsh018/udemy-docker-mastery.git
