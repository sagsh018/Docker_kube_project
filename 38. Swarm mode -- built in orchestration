1) Here in this section we are going to unbox one of the major evelution for docker and that is Docker Swarm
2) So what is the reason behind having docker swarm, which is built-in orchestration for docker
3) below are the reasons for it:
    a) How can we automate container lifecycle
    b) how can we easily scale out/in/up/down
    c) How can be sure our containers are re-created if they fail
    d) How can we replace the containers without downtime(blue/green deply)
    e) How can we control and track where the containers get started
    f) How can we create cross node virtual networks
    g) How can we ensure only trusted servers run our containers
    h) How can we store secrets, keys, passwords, and get them to the right container(and only that container)
4) So to solve all the above problems, we reach out to solution:
   
    Swarm Mode : Built-in orchestration
    ====================================
1) Swarm mode is a clustering solution built inside docker that brings together different operating systems/hosts/nodes into a single manageable
    unit, that you can then orchestrate the lifecycle of your containers in 
2) Just to make it clear in this section we are not going to talk about the swarm which is also called as Swarm "classic", which was a add to
    docker before 1.12 versions of docker came out. This was just a container that would run inside docker, that takes our docker run command in
    repeated amount on multiple server. So this does solve some problems but still could not resolve 80% of the cases.
3) But in dockerconn in summer of 2016 docker added swarmkit toolkit in version 1.12 in summer of 2016. This swarmkit  toolkit is a set of 
    libraries or a toolkit related around a whole bunch of new swarm features, and then they stuck that right into the docker server.
4) Then in January 2017 docker enhanced its swarmkit and enhanced its functionality by adding new features like: Stacks and Secrets.
5) Note that by default docker is not enabled on any of the system having docker installed. You need to enable it before running and without    
    enabling non of the below commands of swarm will work
    - docker swarm
    - docker node
    - docker service
    - docker stack
    - docker secret 
6) So this wonderful design of docker by making swarm part of docker server but not enabled by default, makes its really easy, for people who 
    do not want to make use of docker swarm or they want to make use of other orchestration tool on top of docker, like kubernetes.

Some Basic Concepts
===================
1) Please consider the basic diagram for swarm manager and workers design in file "Diag1-basic_manager_worker_design.png" in same working directory
    Explaination of diagram:
    a) The blue boxes at the top are called as manager nodes, and they have database locally on them, known as a raft database.
    b) This raft database stores the configuration and gives all the required information to manager nodes, which they need have to be the 
        authority inside a swarm.
    c) So in our Daig1 we have three different managers that are added to swarm and they all keep a cpy of that database and encrypt the traffic
        in order to ensure integrety and gurantee the trust that they are able to manage the swarm securely.
    d) Below the manager nodes in diag1 we have our worker nodes. So now we can see that in the concept of swarm we have managers and workers
    e) Each one of these manager and worker nodes will be a virtual machines or physical machine running some distrubution of linux or windows
        server 
    f) Also this diag1 shows us how they communicate each other over control planes, which is how oredrs are sent around the swarm for taking 
        actions
2) Now consider another diag2 which is more complicated version of above diag1 : Diag2-complicated_manager_worker_design.png
    Explaination of diagram:
    a) So at the top we can see the raft concensus database which is replicated among all the nodes/managers.
    b) So Managers issue orders down to workers
    c) Also note that you can promote and demote the nodes into two different roles, that means managers can also be workers and vice verse.
    d) So if we think about the manager, than we can also view them as workers, with the extra permissions to control swarm
    e) The main required for all these nodes is that they should be running same docker which we have used till now.
3) Now consider another diagram which is used to picturized how our containers will look in this swarm configuration: 
    Diag3-Containers_setup_in_swarm_mode.png
    a) So in this diagram we will try to understand how our containers will look like in this swarm setup.
    b) So till now with the help of "docker container run" we were just able to start and stop a single container and this also does not have
        anything feature to scale up and scale down in number of containers.
    c) So in case of swarm mode our docker run command gets replaced with the docker service command, amd this allows us to add extra features 
        our container when we run it such as how many replica's of the same container do we want to run and those are going to be known as tasks
    d) So a single service(swarm service) can have multiple tasks and each one of those tasks will launch a container 
    e) So in our diag3, we have created the service using "docker service create" to spin up an nginx service using nginx image like we used 
        before and several times before, but this time we told it that we want 3 replica's. So it will use the manager nodes to decide,
        where in the swarm to place those three replica's. by default it tries to spread them out, so each node gets it own copy nginx container
        upto the 3 replica's that we have mentioned in the docker service command.
4) Then finally we have a diag4, which tells us exactly what happens when we run docker service create command.
    Diag4-docker_service_create_background.png
    a) So in this Daig4 we are trying to understand what all happens and who are involded behind the scene when docker service create command
        is executed.
    b) So according to the diagram, we have worker nodes that we continuously reporting to manager nodes and asking for new work.
    c) than we have manager nodes which include multiple roles like the dispatcher, scheduler, Allocator and Orchestrator and API.
    d) for example, if you tell docker container serivce to add 3 more replica's then orchestrator will reconciliate and order workers to
        increase the number of replica's.
