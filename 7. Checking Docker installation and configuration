1) So here we are firtly going to see what all we are going to cover in this section. i.e. containers
2) So containers are fundamental building blocks of docker tool kit.
3) Below are the things we are going to cover here
    a) Check versions of our docker Cli and engine.
    b) Create nginx web server container.
    c) Learn common container management commands
    d) Learn Docker networking basics
    e) For all the above steps we need to make sure we have latest version of docker installed on our system.
4) So first thing that we are interested to check here is that we have to check version of our docker client and docker 
    engine/server.
    # docker version
    So this command is going to give us the version of our docker cli where we are going to type our commands. This is 
    same in case of all windows, linux and mac and the next thing it gives is the version of docker engine
    in case of windows we have docker engine running as a service/VM in virtualbox and in case of linux and Mac its just 
    daemon running in the backgroud.
    Client:
        Version:           19.03.1
        API version:       1.40
        Go version:        go1.12.7
        Git commit:        74b1e89e8a
        Built:             Wed Jul 31 15:18:18 2019
        OS/Arch:           windows/amd64
        Experimental:      false

    Server: Docker Engine - Community
        Engine:
        Version:          19.03.12
        API version:      1.40 (minimum version 1.12)
        Go version:       go1.13.10
        Git commit:       48a66213fe
        Built:            Mon Jun 22 15:49:35 2020
        OS/Arch:          linux/amd64
    So here my CLi is talking to the server running in the backgroud in virtual box and returning me the version of 
    both CLI itself and the server as well/
    So this basically indicates that our cli can talk to docker engine and we are good to go
5) Now lets consider another command to get more information about the docker.
    # docker info
    This shows most of the configuration values for the engine.
    Some of the information provided by this command is basic information abor number of containers running, number
    of images running. Other information we are going to study later in this course.
6) We can ge the list of commands that we can run with docker by using below command
    # docker
    Now this list gives both the old way of running the commands as well gives new way of running the commands
    Like:
    docker run // This was the old way of running the docker
    docker container run // This is a new way of running the same command.
    Notice both the new and old commands still works fine with docker.

Summary
=======
1) command : docker version
    This verify our cli can talk to docker engine.
2) command : docker info    
    This gives most of the configuration information about docker engine,
3) Docker command line structure
    old : docker command (optons)
    new : docker command sub-command
