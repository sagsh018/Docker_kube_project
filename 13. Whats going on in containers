1) Here we are going to run docker commands in CLI to understand whats actually going on inside the container.
2) Below are the commands we are going to use in order to check what actually going inside containers:
    a) docker container top -- Gives process list in one container
    b) docker container inspect -- Gives details of one container configuration
    c) docker container stats -- Gives performance stats for all the containers running in kind of real time.
3) So lets bring up two containers:
    # docker container run --publish 80:80 --name webserver --detach nginx
    # docker container run --publish 3306:3306 --name dbserver --detach --env MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes mysql
4) Check out both the containers
    # docker container ls
        CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                               NAMES
        3824cc70fd6d        mysql               "docker-entrypoint.s"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp, 33060/tcp   dbserver
        0e29563c2f05        nginx               "/docker-entrypoint."   9 minutes ago        Up 9 minutes        0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp                  webserver
5) Now lets start digging inside our container:
    # docker container top webserver
        This shows the process running inside the container.
    # docker container top dbserver  
        This is going to show us the mysqld daemon process running inside the container.
    # docker container inspect webserver   
        So this inspect command shows us the metadata about the container such as what is the startup configuration of the container, what all  
        are the volumes, networking information about the container, etc in a JSON format.
    # docker container inspect dbserver
        same as above.
6) So till now the above commands have given lots of data and metadata about the containers, but they didn't provided the live stats of the 
    running container. To find that out we are going to make use of below commands
    # docker container stats <container name is optional>
        CONTAINER ID        NAME                CPU %               MEM USAGE / LIMIT     MEM %               NET I/O             BLOCK I/O           PIDS
        3824cc70fd6d        dbserver            0.52%               325.1MiB / 985.4MiB   32.99%              1.01kB / 0B         40MB / 304MB        37
        0e29563c2f05        webserver           0.00%               2.188MiB / 985.4MiB   0.22%               1.52kB / 0B         10.5MB / 8.19kB     2
    So here we get the live stats about the container, like the CPU utilization, memory utilization, network I/O rate, Block I/O rate, etc
    Also notice that we are not getting the name of the container here, we are just getting the container ID
