In this section we will learn 
1) Two different types of containers windows can run
2) Learn which docker edition to install on your windows version
3) Learn differences between windows 10 and windows server 2016

==>So there are two different types of containers : Linux containers and windows containers
==>Linux containers are still default, when we say just containers, it by default means linux containers and for windows
    containers we will specifically mention windows containers.
    Both types of containers are treated in a same way and they have small differences between the binary they run inside
==>Docker for windows only comes for windows 10 Pro/Enterprise editions only.
==>for windows 7/8/8.1 or windows 10 home, basics should use docker toolbox.
==>Windows server 2016 also support Docker for windows.
==>on windows its getting better and evolving new features rapidly. for example, Microsoft has announced that they will
    come up with : "Native Linux containers"

Docker on windows 10 Pro/Enterprise
===================================
1) Use docker for windows, from store.docker.com 
2) More feature then just a Linux VM
3) Uses hyper-V with tiny Linux VM for Linux containers, which inturn appears to be windows containers to us.
4) Its power sell native.

Docker on windows 7/8 and 10 home
=================================
1) It uses Docker toolbox, and not as fancy as that of Docker for windows.
2) we can download it from store.docker.com
3) Runs tiny Linux VM in VirtualBox via docker-machine.
4) Uses bash shell to make it more like linux
5) Does not support windows containers.

Docker on windows server 2016
=============================
1) This support windows native containers. means it runs a windows binary out of the box without hyper-V or anything 
    installed in a docker container
2) It does also support docker for windows, but it is not required. So only do this when you run windows 2016 locally
    for dev/test. Not for prod.
