Few Things to notice here
=========================
1) Docker is no longer just a "container runtime"
2) Docker moves fast. it matters how you install it
3) Docker CE(community edition) == This is a open source software available in a market.
4) There are 3 major types installs of Docker 
    a) Linux installation -- Here we just install it on a supported OS, meaning that it runs on that Kernal of OS.
        So this is more of direct installation method
    b) Windows 10 Installation/Mac Installation -- Here this is not a direct instalation of Docker on Kernel. its a a suit 
        of tools, including GUI, and settings, preferences and all that to make it very easy to run linux containers which 
        can be seen as windows 10 containers. because in order to run Docker on Windows 10 and Mac, there has to be a small
        Linux Virtual machine has to be started in order to run containers on windows and Mac. So they are ultimately 
        linux containers in the backgroud, but appears to be running on Windows 10 and Mac.
    c) Docker for cloud -- (AWS/Azure/Google). These versions comes with docker installed on linux with them, and also
        they come with features specific to that cloud vendor. So with AWS for example it comes with cloud formation 
        template, it comes with persistent storage options for storing your databases, etc.

CE vs EE & Stable vs Edge
=========================

CE (Free) -- comes after larger platform testing
EE (Paid) -- Specific to perticular platform, and have 24*7 service supported

Edge -- This is basically a beta version, and it comes out every month and only supported for a month untill the new
    beta version comes out.
Stable -- This rlls out for every 3 months of edge feature and extra 1 month in order to test new beta version and 
    install its stable for next 3 month
EE -- This has longer life span.
