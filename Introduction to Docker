Advantages of Docker containers:
    1) Containers are consistent across the board. They allows you to package the same way, regardless of your operating 
        system, it allows you to distribute the software regardless of the setup.
    2) Containers allows you to run and test software the same way, everyware you are running it, may be it mac, windows,
        PC, cloud, Data center or anything. They all run the softare in a same way fundamentally when they are using 
        Docker.
    3) As we all know there are lots and lots of software that we have invented over the last decade and now we have
        whole new task of maintaining those software. so 80% of any IT professional is going into maintaining that old
        software instead of new innovation. and here comes the Docker which helps freeing up lots of this time and 
        enabling us to invest time in innovation instead of maintaining old software.
    4) To migrate your application to container or what we call it containerizing the application doesn't require any 
        new coding and modification of an application because containerization ijust another way of running those 
        applications, which makes it even more easy to migrate.
    5) Docker containers help in huge infrastructure saving.
