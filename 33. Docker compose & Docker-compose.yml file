1) So Docker compose is a combination of a command line tool and a configuration file.
2) So why do we actually need Docker compose:
    a) It configures the relationship between containers
    b) save our docker container run settings in easy-to-read file called Docker-compose.yml file 
    c) put different containers into descrete networks and then establish relationship between them and only expose the public port.
    d) Spin up all the containers and turn them all down with just a single command and this docker-compose.yml file.
    e) and hence create one-liner developer environment start up.
3) There are two parts of docker compose:
    a) YAML-formatted file that describes out solution options for :
        - containers
        - networks
        - volumes
        - Environment variables
        - images
        - All sorts of other configuration options
    b) A CLI tool which is docker-compose used for local dev/test automation using that YAML file 
4) So now lets talk about our docker-compose.yml file
    a) So docker-compose.yml file has its own versions like : 1, 2, 2.1, 3, 3.1, ... These version are based on what all we can add in our 
        docker-compose.tml file.
    b) This YAML file can be used with CLI tool docker-compose command for local docker automation.
    c) This YAML file can also be used directly with docker in production with swarm (as of v1.13)
    d) We have all the help availabel with our docker-compose --help 
    e) docker-compose.yml is a default file name but we can use other names as well with the docker-compose -f option.
5) Now lets look at the example of template for docker-compose.yml and some of the sample docker-compose.yml files under below directory
    compose-sample-1/
        -rw-r--r-- 1 Sagar 197121  540 Jun 27 23:58 compose-2.yml
        -rw-r--r-- 1 Sagar 197121 1158 Jun 27 23:58 compose-3.yml
        -rw-r--r-- 1 Sagar 197121  205 Jun 27 23:58 docker-compose.yml
        -rw-r--r-- 1 Sagar 197121  541 Jun 27 23:58 template.yml
6) template.yml file tels about about the basic part of the docker-compose.yml file and what all we could incode inside this file.
7) Then lets have a look at the compose-sample-1/docker-compose.yml file which is made for the below docker run command
    ================================================================================
    docker container run -p 80:4000 --detach -v $(pwd):/site bretfisher/jekyll-serve
    =================================================================================
    If we check out the docker-compose.yml file for this one We can see how we have mentioned the container name as service in this yaml file
    also how we have mentioned our image, how we have mentioned the volume, and finally how we have mentioned the ports.
8) similary there are two more compose file example where there are more than one container/services are spun using those docker-compose.yml files
    go and refer them thye are just for understanding.
