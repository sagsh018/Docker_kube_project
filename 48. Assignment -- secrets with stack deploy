1) So here we are again going to create a drupal website with the help of official images of drupal and postgres.
2) This time we are going to make use of secrets to pass postgres password to the container
3) We will be precreating the secret for postgres password and then use external in secret key to mark it as tru.
4) following compose file will be used for deploying the stack
    secrets-assignment-1/docker-compose.yml
5) steps:   
    a) firstly modify the docker-compose.yml file as per this assignmnet
    b) after modifying and adding secrets to the docker-compose.yml file, lets precreate the secrets using below command on node1 
        node1:
        # echo "brDSLsd" | docker secret create psql_pw -
        # docker secret ls 
            ID                          NAME                DRIVER              CREATED             UPDATED
            ur4zl2o4zxmno54r5dh6hwz3i   psql_pw                                 4 seconds ago       4 seconds ago
        So now we have pre created the secret, now we will update the created compose file to node1
        # vi docker-compose.yml
    c) # docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml mysite
    d) docker stack ls
        NAME                SERVICES            ORCHESTRATOR
        mysite              2                   Swarm
    e) docker stack ps  mysite
        ID                  NAME                IMAGE               NODE                DESIRED STATE       CURRENT STATE                ERROR               PORTS
        lo80085qeshh        mysite_postgres.1   postgres:12.1       node2               Running             Running about a minute ago
