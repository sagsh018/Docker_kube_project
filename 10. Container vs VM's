Things to node about container
1) Container aren't Mini VM's
2) Container are just the processes
    Lets take an example of running up a new container using an image named "mongo"
    => docker container run --name mongo --detach mongo
        So since we don;t have mongo image locally so docker is going to download this from the docker hub
    => docker container ls 
        This is going to show a new container running with name mongo.
    => docker container top mongo
        Now this is going to show the process running inside the container for mongo.
3) If you notice in the above steps we have listed the process running inside the mongo container using 
    docker container top mongo command.
    if we will search the same process on the local host(Linux VM running on VB in our case) you will find the same
    process running there as well.
    => docker-machine ssh
    => ps -ef | grep -i mongo
        999       4619  4598  2 21:19 ?        00:00:06 mongod --bind_ip_all
    This is a same process running on the host machine for this container that is shown by the docker container top
    command.
4) So this shows that docker container is nothing but just a normal process running on host machine.
5) if you stop it
    => docker container stop mongo
    => docker-machine ssh
    => ps -ef | grep -i mongo  ===> now you won't find the same process running anymore.
6) To start the stopped container again.
    => docker container start mongo
